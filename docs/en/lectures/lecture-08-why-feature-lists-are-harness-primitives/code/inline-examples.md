# Inline examples: Lecture 08. Use Feature Lists to Constrain What the Agent Does

Templates and example snippets from the original lecture text, kept verbatim so the shortened lecture loses nothing.

## 1. Define a Minimal Feature List Format

```json
{
  "id": "F03",
  "behavior": "POST /cart/items with {product_id, quantity} returns 201",
  "verification": "curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/cart/items -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{\"product_id\":1,\"quantity\":2}' | jq .status == 201",
  "state": "passing",
  "evidence": "commit abc123, test output log"
}
```

## 3. Write the Rules in CLAUDE.md

```text
## Feature List Rules
- Feature list file: /docs/features.md
- Only one feature active at a time
- Verification command must pass before marking as passing
- Don't modify feature list states yourself — the verification script updates them automatically
```
